## WTH-2020

After trying to commit to making one project a month, Covid hit the world and everything came crashing down. I lost my job, had to start looking for something new, preparing and taking online tests, interviews and deadlines, etc. Luckily, in April I landed a new job. And I have been trying to learn and catch up on things while on the job. I don't really get to work on personal projects these days mainly because I take the time on weekends to work on work-related research and learning.

But every now and then I go on twitter, see other people write about their projects and achievements and I feel bad about not sticking to my old plan. But then again, it seems like a lot of other people are going through the same thing of feeling like '2020 is giving you more time to work on your goals and you should be achieving all of them. Instead, you have just wasted away 2 months and you haven't even crossed one item from your TODO list...'. I know that it's not healthy to put so much pressure on yourself when things are already this stressful. So I am letting things slide, just for this year.

I just experienced a family member's death and went through an existential crisis. I am trying to be more patient with myself now. Trying... REAL HARD.

I am rambling now, this is a blog post and I am rambling. 

Anyways, I want to update the look of my personal site and add one or two projects to my portfolio. Not making any grand plans, just going to see what I can come up with. ~Rambling ends~
