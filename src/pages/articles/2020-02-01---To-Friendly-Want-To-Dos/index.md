## The Problem

I constantly have this fear that I am not living up to my full potential and then I dive into deep despair telling myself that I am worthless and know nothing. And in between I find myself always wanting to do more and be more. A few years ago, I started making lists. Adding to the lists any ideas I had, anything I wanted to learn more about and so on. With time, the list grew in size but nothing was ever crossed off. Then I started to make new lists, new lists containing links to old lists. Until one day, I realized I had one too many lists.

Okay, so enough rambling for now, so for 2020 I want to make sure I don't add anything more to my endless lists. I am going to try to go through each one and check them off accordinally. I guess that's my only resolution this year.

And I also want to work on one small project every month of the year. So I have 12 projects to show for at the end of 2020. I guess that's another resolution.

Maybe I will look back in a year and see this post and realize that I failed. Let's not get too negative too early.
Note to future self: I always knew you had it in you to achieve this!!
